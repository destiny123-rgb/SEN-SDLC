    <h1>Student Result Management System</h1>
    <p><strong>Course:</strong> SEN 201</p>
    <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> SDLC Implementation</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Requirement Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The Student Result Management System is designed to manage and process
            student academic results. The system should be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accept student name</li>
            <li>Accept multiple student scores</li>
            <li>Calculate total and average score</li>
            <li>Assign grades based on average score</li>
            <li>Display the final result clearly</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. System Design</h2>
        <p>
            The system is designed using Python programming language.
            The following functions are used in the design and implementation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>get_scores()</strong> – collects student scores</li>
            <li><strong>calculate_average()</strong> – calculates total and average</li>
            <li><strong>assign_grade()</strong> – assigns grade based on average</li>
            <li><strong>display_result()</strong> – displays the student result</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The system is implemented using Python. All function names used
            in the design stage are strictly maintained in the implementation
            to ensure consistency.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Testing</h2>
        <p>
            The system was tested using different sets of student scores
            to ensure correct calculation of total, average, and grade assignment.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            The system is deployed as a Python program and hosted on GitHub
            for easy access, usage, and submission.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
            Future improvements may include adding more subjects,
            saving results to a file, or developing a graphical user interface.
        </p>
